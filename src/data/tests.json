        "description": "When you hear the word «panda», Kung Fu Panda is the first thing that comes to your mind. Pandas are an extremely popular animal. They look nice. Even small children recognize a panda when they see it. Still, most present-day toddlers know about pandas from movies and not books. Pandas are also called «panda bears». The general life span of a panda is 20 years if they are wild. It can be up to 25 years if they are captive and protected. There is an interesting thing about the eye patch of the pauda. When a panda is a cub, it is circular in shape. Alony its life journey it changes to the shape of a teardrop. Pandas are only found in China. For quite a while now, Chinese people have used panda as symbol of peace. In ancient times, a white flag with a picture of panda was raised in order to declare peace during wars.",

They had calculated its probable position but there was no proof that the planet really existed. It was too far away for the telescopes of that time to find it. It's worth mentioning that the first photos of the planet were taken by a very young researcher. He was only twenty-four and had no formal education in astronomy. However he was deeply involved in the search for the ninth planet. The planet at the edge of the solar system was called Pluto, after the Roman god. The name for the planet was suggested by an 11-year-old British girl.",
