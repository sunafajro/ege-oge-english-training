        "description": "When you hear the word «panda», Kung Fu Panda is the first thing that comes to your mind. Pandas are an extremely popular animal. They look nice. Even small children recognize a panda when they see it. Still, most present-day toddlers know about pandas from movies and not books. Pandas are also called «panda bears». The general life span of a panda is 20 years if they are wild. It can be up to 25 years if they are captive and protected. There is an interesting thing about the eye patch of the pauda. When a panda is a cub, it is circular in shape. Alony its life journey it changes to the shape of a teardrop. Pandas are only found in China. For quite a while now, Chinese people have used panda as symbol of peace. In ancient times, a white flag with a picture of panda was raised in order to declare peace during wars.",

They had calculated its probable position but there was no proof that the planet really existed. It was too far away for the telescopes of that time to find it. It's worth mentioning that the first photos of the planet were taken by a very young researcher. He was only twenty-four and had no formal education in astronomy. However he was deeply involved in the search for the ninth planet. The planet at the edge of the solar system was called Pluto, after the Roman god. The name for the planet was suggested by an 11-year-old British girl.",

        "description": "There are some strategies to make people think the way you do. The general truth is that the best way to win an argument is to avoid it but this is not always possible. If you have to confront a challenging point of view, show maximum respect for the other person's opinion and never say «You're wrong». Your chances to take the upper hand will rise if you talk in a friendly way and carefully ask questions to which the other person will answer «Yes». Interestingly, social psychologists have noticed that a very good strategy is to let the other person do a great deal of the talking. Listen attentively for the weak points. If you want your ideas to win, make the other person feel as if your ideas are his or hers. Make every effort to see honestly the things from the other person's point of view.

The father worked as a tax collector and the young man wanted to make his job easier. The talented inventor made several machines, but nobody was interested. The young man was ahead of his time. Many years passed before people realized how useful these machines could be and started mass producing them. Today most mechanical calculators have been replaced with electronic models. These small devices can perform a lot of mathematical operations. You just need to enter the numbers by pressing the keys and you’ll see the final result on the screen in no time.",

        "description": "The mystery of why trees don’t stop growing is still unsolved. Human beings usually stop growing sometime during their teens. Many animals reach full growth within a year. Others are fully grown in just a few years. Birds and insects also stop growing at a certain age. But trees keep growing as long as they live. Trees live, grow, and reproduce themselves by an amazing process. The thousands of leaves put forth by the tree breathe for it and manufacture its food. Its root system gathers minerals and vast quantities of water. To carry this water to the leaves, the tree is equipped with an intricate circulation system that extends upward from the millions of root hairs through the trunk and branches. The trunk holds the leaves up to the sunlight, sends them water from the roots, and gets food back from them. Then seeds are borne in flowers or cones.",

The rainforests are the world's greatest natural resources. They are called the lungs of our planet. Half of all the kinds of plants and animals that exist on the planet live in the rainforests. Unfortunately, the area with rainforests is being reduced due to global warming. 100 years ago, the rainforests covered 14 per cent of the earth’s surface. Now, it is only 6 per cent. Scientists say that if the process continues at this rate, the rainforests will have disappeared in 40 years.",

The computer can store the contents of a library. And you probably know the names of some famous inventors like Henry Ford or Steve Jobs. But for every famous invention and inventor there are many everyday objects which we don’t notice and we don’t know who invented them. Take the inventor Nils Bohlin who invented the modern-day car seatbelt. His invention has saved millions of lives. There were other types of seatbelt, but he developed the first one which went across the chest and across the legs and then joined at the same place. Amazingly, this was a very simple idea which no one had tried before - and that’s probably true of so many great inventions.",

They can travel for days in places where temperatures are as high as 40 degrees and where the rainfall can be as low as 20 mm per year. They often carry heavy loads in these conditions, but people don’t only use them for transportation. Camels also produce milk, and because they can weigh as much as 700 kilogrammes, they also provide a lot of meat. So camels have many great qualities, but how many of us would describe camels as a beautiful? Camels have a large hump, strange knees, skinny legs and ugly teeth. They are not beautiful. But not everyone agrees. Once a year, people bring their camels to an area of land in Abu Dhabi. They are here to find the most beautiful camel. There are around 24 000 camels in the competition which last ten days and the judges have to find the best for the final day.",
